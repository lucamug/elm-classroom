# Notes

* Start with one "Repls" for all. Then

    * Using the "Elm template"
    * > elm init
    * > elm repl

        * Work in elm-repl

    * > elm reactor
    * Create Luca.elm

        * Work on Luca.elm (Hello, world!)

    * Limitations of "elm reactor"

        * Cannot control index.html (no ports)
        * Cannot use --debug mode
        
* Move to multiple "Repls"

    * Using the repo https://github.com/lucamug/elm-bootstrap
    * yarn install
    * Be sure that cmd/review works, otherwise: 

        * cd review
        * elm make src/ReviewConfig.elm

    * Based on elm-go (JS tool that watch folders and run "elm make")
    * Has several commands (in cmd folder)
    * Can review/test/build/deploy etc. Works with these out of the box
